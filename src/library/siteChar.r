# Site characterization function, the golden standard way
#
# Input:
#
#   station.name  Name of station to characterize (must belong the list of officially
#                 known stations stored in StationList.csv file), or nothing. In this
#                 case the list of station names is printed.
#
#   d             List of type "sonic.eddy.cov.data" containing results of this station
#                 processing, or NULL if the station processing is to be done from scratch.
#                 This parameter is ignored if "station.name" is NULL.
#
# Result:
#
#   A list of type "sonic.eddy.cov.data" containing the processing results, if
#   this has been done or used; a NULL otherwise.
