\begin_layout Title
Computational Tools for Atmospheric Turbulence
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Foreword
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The study of turbulence in the Earth atmosphere has many important applications,
 from air quality to agriculture.
 Available data abound to date, as ultrasonic anemometers find more and
 more use in both measurement campaigns and fixed stations.
 As data accumulate, so does the need of getting sense from them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By their nature, ultrasonic anemometer data are quite massive.
 In many case data acquisition rate is higher than or equal to 10 Hz, meaning
 at least 36000 data packets per hour.
 All this mass of information demands quite a bit of computational work
 to get a useful synthesis.
 Which

 of computational work, however?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Experiences made all over the world in last years suggest the data analysis
 involved in atmospheric turbulence tends to be interactive, with exploration
 intertwined with more definitive processing steps.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many excellent libraries and tools exist to date supporting the analysis
 of ultrasonic anemometer data (among them, with no claim of exhaustiveness,
 the EdiRe package, or AltEddy program, or ECpack library).
 We found them all extremely powerful and inspiring, yet difficult to use
 them for our purpose: teaching and learning analysis of turbulence data
 (and not only eddy covariance, on which most of the software available
 tend to focus).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We then tried to build our own tools, starting quite informally with a collectio
n of R and Fortran modules, collected under the name of

.
 Humbly, we stand on the shoulders of the giants who preceded us - and just
 try to make instruments easier to use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the meanwhile it may be worth - and not irrelevant to this work - mentioning
 who 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

we
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 are: students, teachers and other people within the Lab Course on Environmental
 Physics at University of Milan.
 The fact this effort has involved students directly has much to do with
 how we feel experimental physics is: a knowledge building process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is true of the subject in itself, as turbulence in the lower atmosphere
 is undergoing quick evolution.
 But also applies to the process of

\end_inset

study
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: the subject badly adapts to traditional ways of imparting established
 knowledge from top, so that students 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

have to
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 build their own knowledge interacting actively with the subject, by formulating
 hypotheses, testing them, and establishing connections among the various
 parts and with the remaining of natural world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This of course does not mean tests and examinations are not necessary.
 On the contrary.
 But on the other side, if a student has decided to join the Lab fully realizing
 the possible difficulties then s/he is already

in

, if not in experience, then at least in passion.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All that said, we add the subject of atmospheric turbulence is in itself
 highly mathematical.
 The methods under common use resemble in their phylosophy data mining,
 in their use of demanding tools on very large datasets, drawing meanwhile
 core ideas from the theory of stochastic processes, fluid dynamics, determinist
ic chaos, and other respectable beasts.
 All we may

discover

 using these complex tools should be critically assessed every time, the
 danger of overmathing being all but light.
 In addition, however complex our methods may be, we should always be able
 to explain results to a community in which physicists and mathematicians
 are just one, and possibly minority, component.
 We admit things can be quite complicate on times - but we .
